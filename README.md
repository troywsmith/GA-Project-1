## Pac-Man 

### Core Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (jQuery for Dom manipulation)


### Approach taken:

- started by creating board with 100 divs. then assinging classes to each div (pacman, enemy, border, block)
- created pacman movement by adding and removing classes to Divs
- pacman moved by adding 'pacman' class when player hit certain keys
- enemy movements were created by generating random numbers and movements when a collision with a border was detected (if statements)

### Main challenges:

- Scalability
- Needed more time to fix certain functions (ex: having pacman wrap around board to other side)

## Frogger

### Core Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- HTML Canvas (used for entire project)

### Approach taken:

- started by creating a canvas and calculating 1/20 (this is how i made a mental grid to place and move objects)
collision detection
created frogger movement by adding and subtracting x and y values
- pacman moved according to users key strokes
- enemy movements were created by generating random numbers and movements when a collision with a border was detected (if statements)


### Main Challenges:

- styling
- perfecting collision detection (need more functions to detect all outside edges of each object)
